* This is a new release.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the quotes "..." around the title.

* Changed the description in order to avoid starting it with "This package", package name, title or similar..

* Removed unnecessary line breaks in the description field.

* Added if(verbose){cat(..)} in R/mpitb.est.R to optionally suppress information messages to the console.
