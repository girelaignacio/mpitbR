Description: 
    Estimate Multidimensional Poverty Indices disaggregated by population subgroups based on the Alkire and Foster method (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.11.006>. This includes the calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals. Other partial indices such as incidence, intensity and indicator-specific measures as well as intertemporal changes analysis can also be estimated. The standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated considering the complex survey design.
