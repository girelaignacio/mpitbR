Description: 
    Calculate Multidimensional Poverty Indices based on the Alkire and Foster method (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.11.006>. 
    This includes other partial indices such as incidence and intensity of poverty disaggregated by groups or indicators.
    For intertemporal changes analysis, the absolute and relative changes-over-time measures can be estimated for all partial measures.
    The standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated considering the complex survey design.
