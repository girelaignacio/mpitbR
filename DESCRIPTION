Description: 
    A framework for calculating Multidimensional Poverty Indices based on the Alkire-Foster method. 
    Users can obtain MPI partial indices such as incidence (H) and intensity (A) of poverty, other decomposed measures by groups or indicators and estimate changes over time.
    The standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated considering the household survey design.
